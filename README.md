# Tabular-Playground-Series
Approach towards kaggle Tabular Playground Series Competitions
---


![](https://github.com/sagnik1511/Tabular-Playground-Series/blob/main/tab-series-comp.png)

## Goals:
 1. Every single competition holds different type of data structure and thus competitors need to know different set of approach to understand the data and learn other randomized approach to the data to process the trainable data and submit to get placed a decent rank.
 
 2. The folders will hold each single competition approach in IPython Notebook ( .ipynb format ).
 
 3. This will help the beginners to learn more about kaggling and participating in competitions.
